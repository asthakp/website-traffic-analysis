This project is a Website Traffic Analysis Dashboard created using Power BI with data retrieved through SQL queries. The dashboard presents a comprehensive analysis of website traffic over time, including various metrics like session duration, page views, bounce rates, and traffic sources, segmented by devices, regions, and browsers.

## Overview
This dashboard provides a detailed view of website performance, focusing on user interactions across different devices, traffic sources, and regions.
